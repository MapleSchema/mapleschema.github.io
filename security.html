    <h1>Security, Zero-Retention, and Data Protection.</h1>

    <p class="hero-lead">
      MapleSchema is designed for teams who need normalized Canadian open banking transactions
      without taking on the risk of storing sensitive financial data. We keep the attack surface
      small, the architecture simple, and the guarantees clear.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TOP GRID: CORE PRINCIPLES -->
  <section class="grid">

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🔒 Zero Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema operates as a <strong>stateless transformation layer</strong>. Open banking
        transaction payloads are processed in memory and discarded immediately after a response
        is generated.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No databases for transaction data.</li>
        <li>No object storage buckets for payloads.</li>
        <li>No write permissions for storing raw or normalized transactions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If an attacker gained access to our servers, there would be <strong>no historical
        transaction data</strong> for them to exfiltrate.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🇨🇦 Canadian Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema is hosted on <strong>Canadian infrastructure</strong>. Transaction payloads
        are processed within Canada and are not forwarded to third countries as part of the
        normalization process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design aligns with the expectation that Canadian open banking data remains under
        Canadian jurisdiction and helps support regional compliance requirements.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🧱 Minimal Attack Surface</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema is intentionally small and focused: a single-purpose API that normalizes
        transaction payloads. There are no dashboards, user-uploaded files, or complex multi-user
        UX flows that expand the attack surface.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No persistence layer for transaction data.</li>
        <li>No embedded third-party scripts in the transformation path.</li>
        <li>Strict IAM so services only have the permissions they need.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

  </section>

  <!-- API SECURITY & LOGGING -->
  <section class="grid">

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🔑 API Security</h2>
      <p>
        Access to the MapleSchema API is controlled through <strong>API keys</strong> and <strong>Project IDs</strong>issued to
        each project.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All requests must use <code>https://</code> — plain HTTP is not supported.</li>
        <li>Requests require a valid API key sent via header.</li>
        <li>Requests are <strong>rate-limited</strong> to reduce abuse and brute-force attempts.</li>
        <li>Payload sizes are limited to protect service stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Invalid or missing authentication results in clear, deterministic error responses so your
        systems can react predictably.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🪵 Log Hygiene</h2>
      <p>
        Logs are critical for operations, but they are also a common source of accidental data
        leakage. MapleSchema is designed to log <strong>only what is needed to operate the
        service</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No transaction payload bodies are logged.</li>
        <li>No raw descriptions, account numbers, or card details are logged.</li>
        <li>Logs include high-level request metadata such as timestamp, institution code, and
          number of transactions processed.</li>
        <li>Logs are protected and periodically rotated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to provide enough visibility for reliability and debugging, without exposing
        sensitive financial data in logs.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🛡️ Transport & Isolation</h2>
      <p>
        All API access is encrypted in transit using TLS. Only the public HTTPS endpoints are
        exposed; internal components are not directly reachable from the public internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Production and non-production environments are separated, and configuration is managed
        via environment variables rather than hard-coded secrets.
      </p>
    </article>

  </section>

  <!-- ARCHITECTURE & COMPLIANCE PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="grid">

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🏗️ Stateless Transformation Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The core of MapleSchema is a <strong>stateless transformation service</strong>. Your
        systems send open banking transaction payloads, MapleSchema normalizes them into a
        stable JSON schema, and the results are immediately returned to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the response is sent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No transaction data is stored in a database.</li>
        <li>No transaction data is written to disk.</li>
        <li>No transaction data is queued for later batch processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This design keeps the service simple to reason about and significantly reduces the risk
        surface compared to traditional data-processing platforms.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>📚 Compliance-First Design</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema is not a data warehouse or analytics platform. It is an opinionated,
        normalization-first API built to <strong>minimize your regulatory burden</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You retain control of storage, access, and retention policies for normalized data.</li>
        <li>We provide a stable, deterministic schema for downstream systems and auditors.</li>
        <li>Our zero-retention posture is easy to explain to security and compliance teams.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As Canadian open banking standards mature, MapleSchema will track changes in field
        definitions and institution behavior, while keeping the normalization contract predictable.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>🔍 Transparency & Versioning</h2>
      <p>
        Changes to the normalization schema and adapters are versioned and documented. When
        MapleSchema introduces new fields or behavior changes, they are done through explicit
        version bumps (for example, <code>transactions-v1.0</code> to a future version) rather than
        silent changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand exactly how data is being transformed.</li>
        <li>Review changes with your own legal, risk, and compliance teams.</li>
        <li>Confidently upgrade integrations when you are ready.</li>
      </ul>
