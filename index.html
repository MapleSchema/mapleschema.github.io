      MapleSchema takes institution-specific open banking transaction payloads and turns them into one
      stable, opinionated schema your application can rely on across Canadian banks and aggregators.

          Ship features on top of a single schema instead of chasing every bank’s format.

      <h2>🍁 What MapleSchema Does</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema normalizes <strong>open banking transaction payloads</strong> from Canada’s top financial institutions
        into a single <code>transactions-v1.0</code> schema. UTC timestamps, explicit debits/credits,
        and a stable field set — regardless of which bank or aggregator the data came from.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        When you are ready to plug it in, the <a href="/docs.html">Developer Docs</a> show the exact request and response formats.

      <h2>🔒 Zero Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        MapleSchema runs with <strong>no databases, no buckets, and no write permissions</strong>.
        Open banking payloads are processed in memory and destroyed immediately,
        making life easier for your privacy, security, and risk teams.

      <h2>🇨🇦 Canadian Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Hosted on <strong>Canadian servers with no persistence layers</strong>. Payloads never leave the country and
        cannot be captured or stored — even by mistake. Infrastructure is configured to disallow data-at-rest.

      <h2>🛡️ Compliance as a Service</h2>
      <p>
        Security posture, zero-retention guarantee, IAM restrictions, and architecture diagrams —
        bundled into a ready-to-share story so your engineers don’t need to build or document all of this themselves.

      <h2>📘 Deterministic Schema</h2>
      <p>
        Same input → same output. Versioned fields, strict rules, UTC-only timestamps, and conservative categorization.
        A normalization contract your codebase can depend on across all supported institutions.

      <h2>💨 Lightweight, Fast Integration</h2>
      <p>
        Keep your existing connections to banks and aggregators. Drop MapleSchema in front of your ingestion pipeline,
        POST raw open banking transaction payloads, and get normalized transactions back. No more hand-rolled mappers
        for each institution.

        Most teams can wire a proof-of-concept in under a day once they have a project ID and API key.

      <h2>🧩 Canadian Open Banking, 2026 and Beyond</h2>
      <p>
        Start with the largest institutions and leading digital banks. As Canadian open banking APIs roll out across
        more institutions, MapleSchema adds new mappers while your application keeps talking to the same stable schema.

        Your integration targets one contract while MapleSchema keeps pace with bank and aggregator changes.

        Clean UTC timestamps. Explicit <code>direction</code> semantics. Signed <code>amount</code> rules.
        Opinionated naming. Boring consistency that saves real engineering time when you integrate multiple institutions.
